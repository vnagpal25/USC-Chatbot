South Carolina alumna who recently led Title IX engagement and education initiatives at Ohio State University has been leading the universitys new Office of Civil Rights and Title IX", "Often when Im trying to explain what Title IX is I start back at the beginning There was a woman at the University of Maryland who earned her PhD and when she was trying to get hired would hear things like We already have a woman in this department You come on too strong for a woman Her name was Bernice Sandler went by Bunny And shes actually known as the Godmother of Title IX", "On the 50th anniversary of Title IX UofSC Today talked with Peirano about her plans and goals for the office and the future of the landmark civil rights regulation that prohibits sex discrimination in any education program receiving federal funds", "One of the first orders of business has been to create a comprehensive policy that is anti-discrimination anti-harassment and anti-sexual misconduct Right now theres quite a few policies and it can be confusing for people to follow And my thing with policy is people need to know what the expectations are if we want them to meet those expectations Most people want to do the right thing They just need to know what to do Were creating one comprehensive policy and well retire about six other policies I think thatll help communicate our expectations to the community let people know what their rights are and it will help us be more efficient and effective in our work as an office", "Our office is located on the fourth floor of the James F Byrnes building inside suite 401", "People need to know what the expectations are if we want them to meet those expectations Most people want to do the right thing They just need to know what to do", "Sometimes we forget that this started as a faculty issue When people look back at history they think a lot of the athletic aspect which was very important and brought a lot of attention that was well deserved Now I would say were more in the era of sexual misconduct and preventing it keeping people safe"]
