                              one reason U.S. News and World Report recognized South Carolina as the nation’s leader
                              in first-year experience for students among public universities., South Carolina is home to hundreds of degrees, many of which have earned national

                              African American graduation rate being in the top 10% of public universities. , The Carnegie Foundation has recognized the university with top classification — R1

                                    embodiment of the institution’s power and authority. The gift of the medallion accompanied
                                    the gift of the mace, and the linked silver chain of office was commissioned in 1991

                                    is edged in garnet velvet and lined with garnet-and-black silk. The regalia is completed
                                    by a black velvet tam with an antique-gold tassel., The gleaming silver-and-gilt mace is nearly four feet long and features the seals
                                    of the university, the State of South Carolina and the United States. From the middle
                                    arises a stylistic representation of the State Tree, the palmetto. Adopted in 1967,
                                    the mace is carried in procession on occasions of outstanding importance, such as

                                       commemorates the September 17, 1787, signing of the United States Constitution. Written
                                       in 1787, ratified in 1788, and in operation since 1789, the United States Constitution is the world's longest surviving written charter of government. Its first three words
                                       –– "We the People" –– affirm that the government of the United States exists to serve
                                       its citizens. For over two centuries the Constitution has remained in force because
                                       its framers wisely separated and balanced governmental powers to safeguard the interests
                                       of majority rule and minority rights, of liberty and equality, and of the federal
                                       and state governments. Since 1789, the Constitution has evolved through amendments
                                       to meet the changing needs of a nation now profoundly different from the eighteenth-century
                                       world in which its creators lived., To encourage all Americans to learn more about the Constitution, Congress in 1956
                                       established Constitution Week, to begin each year on September 17th, the date in 1787
                                       when delegates to the Convention signed the Constitution. In 2004, Congress added
                                       key provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 2005 designating
                                       September 17th of each year as Constitution Day and requiring public schools and governmental

                                       institutions of higher education to be authorized in states where they provide education
                                       in order to be eligible to receive federal financial assistance.  While parts of these
                                       rules have been challenged and vacated, other rules remain in effect, including state
                                       authorization in individual states. Therefore, since federal and state regulations
                                       continue to evolve regarding state authorization, the University created a page in
                                       order to provide information to its current and prospective students regarding our
                                       authorization and licensure status.  The authorization for the Palmetto College Campuses
                                       is included with the Columbia Campus.   State Authorization, September 17 is Constitution Day and Citizenship Day (Constitution Day). This day
                                       commemorates the September 17, 1787, signing of the United States Constitution. Written
                                       in 1787, ratified in 1788, and in operation since 1789, the United States Constitution is the world's longest surviving written charter of government. Its first three words
                                       –– "We the People" –– affirm that the government of the United States exists to serve
                                       its citizens. For over two centuries the Constitution has remained in force because
                                       its framers wisely separated and balanced governmental powers to safeguard the interests
                                       of majority rule and minority rights, of liberty and equality, and of the federal
                                       and state governments. Since 1789, the Constitution has evolved through amendments
                                       to meet the changing needs of a nation now profoundly different from the eighteenth-century
                                       world in which its creators lived., To encourage all Americans to learn more about the Constitution, Congress in 1956
                                       established Constitution Week, to begin each year on September 17th, the date in 1787
                                       when delegates to the Convention signed the Constitution. In 2004, Congress added
                                       key provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year 2005 designating
                                       September 17th of each year as Constitution Day and requiring public schools and governmental
                                       offices to provide educational programs to promote a better understanding of the Constitution., Each Palmetto College Campus has activities on constitution day, please check the

                                       educational institutions to provide students access to their educational records,
                                       to allow students to correct inaccurate or misleading information in these records,
                                       and to limit the release of information to third parties.  The rights parents exercise

                           								Topics:
                           								Students, Academics, Student Voices, College of Arts and Sciences, Samuel Bagg, assistant professor of political science, writes about the importance
                              of having a democracy and why professional bureaucracies matter in today’s society.
                               , Who makes the rules that govern our daily lives? In a democracy, it’s natural to think
                           that “the people” are in charge, or should be., Of course, hundreds of millions of people can’t participate actively in governing
                           day to day. Still, the idea of representative democracy is that those who make the
                           rules are elected by, and accountable to, everyone else., In fact, however, most national rules and regulations in the U.S. are made by unelected
                           bureaucrats in administrative agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Environmental Protection Agency. And in three cases currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, the legitimacy of this
                           system is under attack., Rulemaking by independent experts has long been an integral part of government. Yet
                           critics on both the left and the right worry about allowing unelected officials to exercise so much power. As a political scientist specializing in the complex and often contentious demands of democracy, I have stated such concerns myself., In my view, though, the current legal challenges are using a sledgehammer to crack
                           a nut. All three cases reflect a broader strategy devised by ultraconservative activists whose ultimate aim is to dismantle the administrative state – agencies with the power
                           to write, judge and enforce regulations that carry the force of law. Depending on
                           how the court rules, its decisions could throw vast swaths of the federal government
                           into disarray., Advocates contend that reducing bureaucratic discretion will protect democracy. But if regulators can’t punish financial fraud or regulate pollution, the result won’t be a thriving democratic society. Rather than eliminating bureaucracy, I see ways to make it more democratic.,  , During the 20th century, governments around the world took on many new responsibilities, from managing national economies and providing health care to making food supplies
                           safer. In the process, they found they needed to grant significant discretion to experts
                           in bureaucratic agencies., Imagine how cumbersome and contentious it would be if, for example, Congress had to
                           pass a new law every time a harmful chemical was identified. Instead, elected lawmakers
                           have authorized the EPA to regulate chemicals that its experts determine are harmful., Regulatory agencies aren’t completely apolitical. Many are led by political appointees,
                           and new administrations often redirect agency priorities. Yet these organizations’ core missions and staffs don’t change radically from one

                           both a cornerstone of modern democracy and a potential source of undemocratic power. When bureaucrats are granted discretion,
                           they may use it in harmful ways, either by caving in to powerful interest groups or simply imposing their own preferences., In my view, though, getting rid of bureaucrats – and returning all discretionary power
                           to the hands of a Congress that’s gerrymandered, gridlocked and awash in special-interest money – is no solution.,  , For many years, the idea of dismantling the administrative state was confined to a radical fringe.

                           how best to reduce power plant emissions. And in three cases on this year’s docket, the court appears poised to further limit

                           because it receives money through the Federal Reserve, not in annual appropriations
                           from Congress. Many other federal programs, including Social Security, are funded through similar processes., – In Securities and Exchange Commission v. Jarkesy, a hedge fund manager charged with fraud is contesting the commission’s enforcement
                           procedures, which are also used by many other agencies. A ruling for the plaintiffs
                           could threaten the use of administrative law judges to adjudicate issues across the executive branch, including workers’ right to organize

                           industry in ways that exceed its authority. Many observers expect that the court will sharply cut back agencies’ discretion
                           to interpret federal laws in deciding how to regulate., None of these rulings would immediately abolish the federal bureaucracy. But they
                           could seriously restrict agencies’ ability to do the critical work of governing a
                           complex modern society.,  , In my book, “The Dispersion of Power: A Critical Realist Theory of Democracy,” I argue that it’s possible to limit overreach and special-interest influence over regulatory agencies without endangering bureaucrats’ ability to serve the public interest.

                           taking all discretion away from regulators, I believe that subjecting their decisions to open challenges and oversight by ordinary citizens could help ensure that agencies use their power well., Such feedback is already part of the regulatory process.

                           								Faculty, Research, College of Arts and Sciences, The Conversation, Samuel Bagg, assistant professor of political science, writes about the importance
                              of having a democracy and why professional bureaucracies matter in today’s society.
                               , Who makes the rules that govern our daily lives? In a democracy, it’s natural to think
                           that “the people” are in charge, or should be., Of course, hundreds of millions of people can’t participate actively in governing
                           day to day. Still, the idea of representative democracy is that those who make the
                           rules are elected by, and accountable to, everyone else., In fact, however, most national rules and regulations in the U.S. are made by unelected
                           bureaucrats in administrative agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Environmental Protection Agency. And in three cases currently before the U.S. Supreme Court, the legitimacy of this
                           system is under attack., Rulemaking by independent experts has long been an integral part of government. Yet
                           critics on both the left and the right worry about allowing unelected officials to exercise so much power. As a political scientist specializing in the complex and often contentious demands of democracy, I have stated such concerns myself., In my view, though, the current legal challenges are using a sledgehammer to crack
                           a nut. All three cases reflect a broader strategy devised by ultraconservative activists whose ultimate aim is to dismantle the administrative state – agencies with the power
                           to write, judge and enforce regulations that carry the force of law. Depending on
                           how the court rules, its decisions could throw vast swaths of the federal government
                           into disarray., Advocates contend that reducing bureaucratic discretion will protect democracy. But if regulators can’t punish financial fraud or regulate pollution, the result won’t be a thriving democratic society. Rather than eliminating bureaucracy, I see ways to make it more democratic., During the 20th century, governments around the world took on many new responsibilities, from managing national economies and providing health care to making food supplies
                           safer. In the process, they found they needed to grant significant discretion to experts
                           in bureaucratic agencies., Imagine how cumbersome and contentious it would be if, for example, Congress had to
                           pass a new law every time a harmful chemical was identified. Instead, elected lawmakers
                           have authorized the EPA to regulate chemicals that its experts determine are harmful., Regulatory agencies aren’t completely apolitical. Many are led by political appointees,
                           and new administrations often redirect agency priorities. Yet these organizations’ core missions and staffs don’t change radically from one
                           administration to the next., This continuity shields much of agencies’ day-to-day work from partisan politics.
                           It also prevents regulators from becoming politicized and corrupt, as often happens when elected officials have tight control over administrators. Yet it also opens
                           agencies to charges that they are too powerful., There are no easy answers here. An independent and professionalized bureaucracy is
                           both a cornerstone of modern democracy and a potential source of undemocratic power. When bureaucrats are granted discretion,
                           they may use it in harmful ways, either by caving in to powerful interest groups or simply imposing their own preferences., In my view, though, getting rid of bureaucrats – and returning all discretionary power
                           to the hands of a Congress that’s gerrymandered, gridlocked and awash in special-interest money – is no solution., For many years, the idea of dismantling the administrative state was confined to a radical fringe.

Introduction to Jewelry Making ARTS 255
Are you creative and fashionable? Like to work with your hands and make amazing things?
                                 Always wanted to use a blowtorch? If you answered yes to any of the above questions,
                                 then Introduction to Jewelry Making might be the class for you.Intro to Jewelry Making gives students the opportunity to get those creative juices
                                 flowing through a unique medium that utilizes tools not so easily accessed on the
                                 day-to-day. This course has three sections, one of which is taught by Thomas Bosse,
                                 who describes his coursework as “a studio art class in which students learn a variety
                                 of jewelry techniques including soldering, torchwork, stone setting, fabrication,
                                 forging/forming, casting, and more. Students approach contemporary art concepts from
                                 a perspective of jewelry and adornment as they create unique designs of their own.” Be warned that this class does have a lab fee and if you want to work on creating
                                 silver jewelry, you will have to provide that material yourself. No matter what you
                                 decide to create, students will leave the semester with an understanding of jewelry
                                 design, their own striking jewelry pieces and the technical skills needed to create
                                 them.

Introduction to Jewelry Making ARTS 255
Are you creative and fashionable? Like to work with your hands and make amazing things?
                                 Always wanted to use a blowtorch? If you answered yes to any of the above questions,
                                 then Introduction to Jewelry Making might be the class for you.Intro to Jewelry Making gives students the opportunity to get those creative juices
                                 flowing through a unique medium that utilizes tools not so easily accessed on the
                                 day-to-day. This course has three sections, one of which is taught by Thomas Bosse,
                                 who describes his coursework as “a studio art class in which students learn a variety
                                 of jewelry techniques including soldering, torchwork, stone setting, fabrication,
                                 forging/forming, casting, and more. Students approach contemporary art concepts from
                                 a perspective of jewelry and adornment as they create unique designs of their own.” Be warned that this class does have a lab fee and if you want to work on creating
                                 silver jewelry, you will have to provide that material yourself. No matter what you
                                 decide to create, students will leave the semester with an understanding of jewelry
                                 design, their own striking jewelry pieces and the technical skills needed to create
                                 them.
