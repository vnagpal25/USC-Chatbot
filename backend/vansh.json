2022 only 485 of booster-eligible people in the US have received their first booster shot and just under 34 of those eligible have received their second These low numbers may in part be influenced by people waiting for the newer versions of the vaccines to provide better protection But booster shots have proven to be an essential layer of protection against COVID-19", "As of late August 2022 the BA4 and BA5 omicron subvariants are dominant worldwide In the US currently 89 of COVID-19 infections are caused by BA5 and 11 are caused by BA4", "Banner image In a matter of days eligible people will be lining up to receive the newly formulated booster shot filadendronE via Getty Images", "Based on available evidence from the previous COVID-19 vaccines we believe it is very likely that the new boosters will continue to offer strong protection from severe COVID-19 leading to hospitalization and death But whether they will protect against reinfection and breakthrough infections remains to be seen", "Based on those results in spring 2022 the FDA rejected the BA1 bivalent boosters because the agency felt the boosters may fall short of providing sufficient protection against the newest strains BA4 and BA5 which were by then spreading quickly throughout the US and the world So the FDA asked Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna to develop bivalent vaccines specifically targeting BA4 and BA5 instead of BA1", "Because clinical trials are time-consuming the FDA was willing to consider animal studies and other laboratory findings such as the ability of antibodies to neutralize the virus to decide whether to authorize the bivalent boosters", "Because mRNA-based vaccines are a relatively new class of vaccines they do not include the traditional adjuvants The current mRNA vaccines used in the US rely on small balls of fat called lipid nanoparticles to deliver the mRNA These lipid molecules can act as adjuvants but how precisely these molecules affect the long-term immune response remains to be seen And whether the current COVID-19 vaccines failure to trigger strong long-lived antibody response is related to the adjuvants in the existing formulations remains to be explored", "Because of the superiority of the bivalent vaccines the FDA has also removed the use authorization for the original monovalent Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines for booster purposes in individuals 18 years of age and older and 12 years of age and older respectively", "Because of this the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently endorsed a second booster shot for individuals 50 years of age and older and people who are immunocompromised Other countries including Israel the UK and South Korea have also approved a second booster", "But when the virus mutates as we know that it does the antibodies that were previously produced in response to the virus can no longer effectively bind to the newly mutated spike protein In this respect the SARS-CoV-2 virus acts like a chameleon a master of disguise by changing its body configuration and escaping recognition by the immune system", "But with certain vaccines such as hepatitis it is necessary to give multiple doses of a vaccine to boost the immune response This is because the first or second dose is not sufficient to induce robust antibodies or to sustain the memory B and T cell response", "COVID-19 infection is unique in that the majority of people who get it recover with mild to moderate symptoms while a small percentage get the severe disease that can lead to hospitalization and death", "Evidence also suggests that in severe cases of COVID-19 the killer T cells may be exhibiting immune exhaustion and therefore be unable to mount a strong immune response Whether repeated COVID-19 vaccine boosters can cause similar T cell exhaustion is a possibility that needs further study", "How well the bivalent vaccines will perform in the face of new variants that might arise will depend on the nature of future spike protein mutations", "However a recent preliminary study from Israel that has not yet been peer-reviewed showed that the second booster did not further boost the immune response but merely restored the waning immune response seen during the third dose Also the second booster provided little extra protection against COVID-19 when compared to the initial three doses", "However if not enough antibodies are produced the virus can escape and infect the host cells When this happens the immune system activates what are known as killer T cells These cells can recognize virus-infected cells immediately after infection and destroy them thereby preventing the virus from replicating and causing widespread infection", "However in human clinical trials and laboratory studies both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna found that their initial version of the bivalent vaccine which was directed against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and an earlier omicron strain BA1 induced a strong immune response and longer protection against both the original strain and the BA1 variant In addition the companies reported that the same early combination generated a significant antibody response against the newest omicron subvariants BA4 and BA5 though this antibody response was lower than that seen against subvariant BA1", "However it has become increasingly clear that the second booster does not provide long-lasting protection against breakthrough infections As a result it will be necessary to retool the existing vaccines to increase the duration of protection in order to help bring the pandemic to an end", "However the vaccines have failed to provide long-term protective immunity to prevent breakthrough infections cases of COVID-19 infection that occur in people who are fully vaccinated", "If it is a minor mutation or set of mutations when compared to the original strain or to omicron variants BA4 and BA5 the new shots will provide good protection However if a hypothetical new strain were to possess highly unique mutations in its spike protein then its likely that it could once again dodge immune protection", "In addition to the inability of the current COVID-19 vaccines to provide long-term immunity some researchers believe that frequent or constant exposure to foreign molecules found in an infectious agent may cause immune exhaustion", "In an actual COVID-19 infection the SARS-CoV-2 virus uses its protruding spike protein to latch onto human cells and gain entry into cells The spike protein triggers the production of so-called neutralizing antibodies which bind to the spike protein and prevent the virus from invading other cells", "It is also noteworthy that influenza vaccines are introduced each year based on prediction of the strain that is likely to be dominant and such formulations do not undergo new clinical trials", "Its a bit of a medical mystery Why are mRNA vaccines so successful in preventing the serious form of COVID-19 but not so great at protecting against breakthrough infections? Understanding this concept is critical for stopping new infections and controlling the pandemic", "On Sept 1 2022 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed the use of updated COVID-19 booster shots that are specifically tailored to combat the two most prevalent omicron subvariants BA4 and BA5 The decision comes just a day after the Food and Drug Administrations emergency use authorization of the shots The CDCs backing will enable a full roll-out of the reformulated vaccines to begin within days", "On the flip side the successful development of the updated vaccines demonstrates that the mRNA vaccine technology is nimble and innovative enough that within a couple of months of the emergence of a new variant it is now likely possible to develop and distribute new vaccines that are tailor-made to fight an emerging variant", "Prakash Nagarkatti and Mitzi Nagarkatti are immunologists who study infectious disorders and how vaccines trigger different aspects of the immune system to fight infection They weigh in on how the updated booster shots train the immune system and how protective they might be against COVID-19", "So while the second booster certainly provides a small benefit to the most vulnerable people by extending immune protection by a few months there has been considerable confusion over what the availability of the fourth shot means for the general population", "Such a phenomenon has been widely reported with HIV infection and cancer In those cases because the T cells see the foreign molecules all the time they can get worn down and fail to rid the body of the cancer or HIV", "That diminished protection even after the third dose is what led the CDC to endorse the fourth shot of COVID-19 vaccine called the second booster for people who are immunocompromised and those aged 50 and older", "The B cells and T cells are unique in that after they mount an initial immune response they get converted into memory cells Unlike antibodies memory cells can stay in a persons body for several decades and can mount a rapid response when they encounter the same infectious agent It is because of such memory cells that some vaccines against diseases such as smallpox provide protection for decades", "The bivalent vaccines can only be used as a booster shot at least two months after the completion of the primary series or initial required shots or following a previous booster shot The Moderna bivalent vaccine is authorized for use in people 18 years of age while the Pfizer bivalent vaccine is authorized for those 12 years of age and older", "The concept of bivalent vaccines aimed at protecting against two different strains of a virus is not new For instance Cervarix is an FDA-approved bivalent vaccine that provides protection against two different types of human papillomaviruses that cause cancer", "The inability of the original vaccine strains to prevent reinfection and to trigger long-term protective immunity prompted the need for the reformulated vaccines", "The mRNA vaccines currently used in the US against COVID-19 have been highly successful at preventing hospitalization and death The Commonwealth Fund recently reported that in the US alone the vaccines have prevented over 2 million people from dying and over 17 million from hospitalization", "The new bivalent vaccines contain a lower dose of mRNA and as such are meant to be used only as boosters and not in people who have never received a COVID-19 vaccination", "The new booster shots one by Moderna and another from Pfizer-BioNTech come as more than 450 people are still dying of COVID-19 every day in the US", "The newly authorized shots are the first updates to the original COVID-19 vaccines that were introduced in late 2020 They use the same mRNA technology as the original vaccines The key difference between the original COVID-19 shots and the new bivalent version is that the latter consists of a mixture of mRNA that encodes the spike proteins of both the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and the more recent omicron subvariants BA4 and BA5", "The ongoing viral mutations are why antibodies produced in response to the original vaccine strains have over time become less effective at fending off infections by new variants", "There are as of yet no human studies on the efficacy of the new bivalent vaccine at preventing reinfections and providing long-term immune protection", "They also build communities allowing researchers at every stage of their career to work toward a common overarching goal And that can only boost the

the FDA to approve a booster without direct human data to support it However the FDA has stated that millions of people have safely received the mRNA vaccines which were originally tested in humans and that the changes in the mRNA sequences in the vaccines do not affect vaccine safety Thus it concluded that the bivalent vaccines are safe and that there is no need to wait for human clinical trials", "Thus there is increasing evidence that antibodies may help prevent breakthrough infections while the killer T cells provide protection against the severe form of the disease", "Understanding how our immune system works during the mild versus severe forms of COVID-19 is also important to the process of developing more targeted vaccines", "When people are first exposed to SARS-CoV-2 the

antibodies The antibodies bind to the protruding spike protein on the surface of the virus This blocks the virus from entering a cell and ultimately prevents it from causing an infection", "While the current vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease the next phase of vaccine development will need to focus on how to trigger a long-lived antibody response that would last for at least a year making it likely that COVID-19 vaccines will become an annual shot", "While the third dose or first booster of COVID-19 vaccines was highly effective in preventing the severe form of

of a broad range of every day applications such as lighting and x-ray detectors for medical and technical applications Luminescent materials also called phosphors consist of a host lattice in which activator ions are doped into in small concentrations typically less than a mole percent The activator ions have energy levels that can be populated by direct excitation or indirectly by energy transfer and are responsible for the luminescence We have discovered a new family of luminescent materials and are currently exploring its use in white light LED applications as well as upconversion

disrupteddisorganized ECM was a common feature in cardiovascular disease These observations led to the discovery that a specific family of ECM degrading enzymes the matrix metalloproteinases MMPs emerged in patients with myocardial remodeling and heart failure Through NIH funding we have now identified that a large portfolio of MMPs are expressed in the progression of heart failure and are not associated with a parallel increase in the endogenous inhibitors of the MMPs TIMPs Using murine constructs large animal pre-clinical models and patient based studies we have identified that a dysregulation between MMPsTIMPs occurs early in the development of heart failure Through pharmacological and transgenic approaches we have established a cause-effect relation between increased MMP proteolytic activity and adverse myocardial remodeling- particularly following a myocardial infarction MI Moreover our clinical studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of MMP induction is directly related to the degree of late post-MI remodeling and the risk of heart failure To that end my recent work as been to focus upon developing diagnosticprognostic biomarker panels of MMPTIMPs

environments Part of their ecological success is due to their cryptophyte phycobiliprotein Cr-PBP accessory pigments that capture wavelengths of light that are not efficiently absorbed by chlorophylls thus allowing them to occupy distinct vertical niches in the water column There are nine defined Cr-PBP types named for their wavelength of maximal absorbance that are responsible for wide differences in color among cryptophyte species Yet very little tis known about how spectral absorption characteristics of Cr-PBPs vary among species In their latest study titled Variability in spectral absorption within cryptophyte phycobiliprotein types Drs Kristiaan Merritt and Tammi Richardson investigated variability in primary and secondary peak absorbance wavelengths and full width at half max FWHM values of spectra of Cr-PBPs extracted from 75 cryptophyte strains 55 species grown under full spectrum irradiance They discovered that there may be substantial differences in spectral shapes within Cr-PBP types and provide additional criteria for classification in cases where the wavelength of maximum absorbance alone is not definitive Thus variations in spectral characteristics among strains containing the same presumed Cr-PBP type may indicate differing chromophore composition andor the presence of more than one Cr-PBP in a single cryptophyte species", "Dean Willie Harriford created the

Dan Speiser our Department Dr Johanna Cannon University of California Santa Barbara Morris Aguilar University of California Santa Barbara and Dr Douglas Eernisse California State University took advantage of two lineages of chitons that have evolved two different visual systems eye spots and shell eyes to test the evolutionary role of path dependence They found that the type of visual system that a chiton lineage can evolve is constrained by the number of openings for sensory nerves in its shell plates Lineages with more nerve openings in their shell evolved eye spots whereas those with fewer openings evolved shell eyes Thus the evolution of complex visual systems which are often portrayed as deterministic is path dependent with events at specific critical junctions constraining lineages to one of a subset of possible pathways", "In their new study titled RasMAPK signaling mediates adipose tissue control of ovarian germline survival and ovulation in Drosophila melanogaster recently graduated Dr Tancia Bradshaw her mentor Dr Alissa Armstrong graduate student Chad Simmons and biological sciences major Rachael Ott investigated the role of the Rasmitogen-activated protein

contain critical junctions which are defined as events that commit lineages to one of multiple possible evolutionary pathways thereby constraining the suite of possible outcomes Path dependence is well established for the evolution of particular proteins in unicellular laboratory systems but has been very difficult to establish in any system outside of the laboratory Indeed demonstrating path

program to include even more students in years to come", "The outside of the virus is covered with a capsid and the inside is a piece of RNA which is the viral genome After decontamination the RNA is uncovered so the tests can detect the virus", "The program attracts capable student populations who might not have otherwise considered research as a goal Simoska says", "The reason why South Carolina is important with regard to location is that the stroke rate here is very high This gives us access to patients more than other places where stroke rates are lower Fridriksson says And the benefit of a large lab like ours in a place like this is that we serve a lot of these patients We include them in our studies and they receive free treatment and rehabilitation", "Theyre initially barcode scanned to be received into the lab Banister says Then they go into an oven for decontamination This heats them up to 95 degrees Celsius which is about 212 degrees Fahrenheit This does two things The first thing is that it breaks down the mucus and the second thing is that it will also break apart the virus particles so theyre no longer infectious", "This lab was one of my top choices because of how it connects chemistry and biochemistry she says But there were a few others that had medical applications as well like the Simoska lab which looks at human physiology to create equipment for health monitoring", "This opportunity can play a pivotal role in guiding students to discover their passion for research early in their college careers with some already expressing interests in pursuing graduate degrees in chemistry Hosseini says", "We also look for a human gene she says This gives us some quality control measures which is important because since we are not purifying the RNA we want to make sure there are no inhibitors in the saliva that cause the tests tonot be accurate", "We did all sorts of inhibitor studies to see what we could put into saliva that we then couldnt detect the virus Banister saysThe researchers tested blood salt caffeine toothpaste mouthwash and more One of the things that inhibits the test most critically is salt", "We put complex organic catalysts into a solution thats almost like cement Budiselich says That makes it so these molecules cant move during the reaction which helps us get as much product as possible", "When I met with my biochemistry advisor for my major she brought up URI as a good option for me Patel says Being able to learn the equipment the methods and techniques all as early as freshman year I was definitely
