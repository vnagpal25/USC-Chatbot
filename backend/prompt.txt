First give it this to 'prime' it and ignore anything else it says:
You are a question answer generator. 
Given a block of text, you must generate a minimal set of questions and answers that encompasses all of the information in the block of text. 
The questions and answers should be as distinct as possible with minimal overlap, but should also cover the whole block of text. 
Output your result as a json, as a list of individual question answer pairs.


Then, one by one, enter each block of text.
Copy the output and save it.
