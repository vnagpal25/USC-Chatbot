anti-inflammatory properties Another way is to team up with biochemists who synthesize small molecule inhibitors of specific pro-inflammatory molecules with low toxicity Our lab also carries out clinical trials to examine the role of anti-oxidants in suppressing systemic inflammation and improve overall health Recent projects have involved the used of genetically modified plants to synthesize microRNAs for chemopreventive properties We are interested in colon cancer disparities and are tackling this issue in collaboration with other leaders at the university including Drs Hebert Berger and

children has been identified with autism spectrum disorder according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention but this condition is even more prevalent in children with certain genetic syndromes such as fragile X syndrome which affects one in 7000 boys and one in 11000 girls Kluseks research shows that about 75 percent of boys with fragile X meet criteria for co-occurring autism However without a genetic or other lab test for autism clinical and educational providers rely on their own assessments to identify the disorder which can pose challenges The features of fragile X

ranks of the universitys assistant and associate professors Their success will help propel the university for years to come ", "The absence of these environments likely explains the accelerated BMI gains that happen in summer Over the years Weaver and his team have worked with schools and local community organizations eg YMCA Boys Girls Club to determine whether a continuation of school-like conditions through camps and other strategic programming can mitigate or even reverse these effects", "The second project will increase access to summer and after-school programming for children from low-income households Using a model long used by SNAP and other federal state and local programs aimed at addressing large-scale public health challenges this study will provide access to after school

during summer", "These women are at increased risk for a range of health problems eg infertility premature menopause neurogenerative disease autoimmunechronic pain disorders depressionanxiety social

a clearer picture of the challenges carriers face Mothers of fragile X children are at risk for a range of mental cognitive and physical health problems all of which can be exacerbated by caregiver stress", "", "Our approach draws on the filled-time perspective which suggests that time filled with favorable activities such as physical activity and healthy eating cannot be filled with unfavorable activities Weaver says Community-operated day camps can exert a positive influence on summer BMI weight gain by offering structured environments that encourage healthy behaviors and limit unhealthy ones", "Pursuing this line of research and having the opportunity to interface with this community of amazing women has truly been a privilege Fragile X moms are tough as nails they never give up and they are the biggest advocates for their children and their families I have often felt inspired by their experiences and have taken away many lessons on parenting life and science from this group of women", "The prevalence of overweight and obesity status among elementary-age children varies between low-income families and middle-to-high-income families Weaver says Providing access to structured programming during the critical hours after school and the 10 weeks of summer vacation will help eliminate these disparities", "The stressors associated with parenting a child with a disability can exacerbate preexisting biological vulnerabilities in mothers who carry the FMR1 premutation says Klusek who notes that older age appears to further increase the risk This is concerning because it is common for adult-aged children who have fragile X syndrome to continue to live with their parents and rely on them for advocacy and daily care well into their adult years Therefore the age-related health of mothers who carry the FMR1 premutation has implications for the outcomes of both the mother and her children", "These findings demonstrate a gross under-identification among male youth with fragile X syndrome says Klusek an associate professor of communication sciences and disorders who studies the genetic mutations communication and cognitive effects on those who have it and their mothers who carry the FMR1 premutation that causes it Individuals with both fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder are at risk for poorer education medical employment and independent living outcomes so early diagnosis is essential to providing access to services that improve their success and quality of life in these areas", "Virtually all increases in body mass index BMI among children ages five to 12 occur during the summer break from school regardless of their weight status prior to the end of the school year says Weaver who is a member of the Arnold Childhood Obesity Initiative Pre-planned segmented and adult-supervised environments like those found in school and after-school programming protect children against obesity-inducing behaviors such as sedentary screen time and unhealthy eating", "With 75 percent of our participants experiencing both fragile X syndrome and autism spectrum disorder its clear that co-occurrence is common Klusek says Education about these

week their classes were every other Friday They had limited experience with online learning once classes went virtual beginning on March 19 Consequently the transition during the summer term was a

end But Watts believes her staff will have a better perspective and appreciation for their job She also believes her staff may not have understood the difficulty of communicating with patients and families by phone and this experience has improved their ability to better communicate", "One of the challenges is that since COVID-19 has prevented Watts staff from entering hospital rooms they may

families and has an interest in substance use Kintzioss dream job is to be an international mental health social worker while Kandetzki desires to work in school or child welfare", "Visitors are not permitted in COVID-19 units and some patients need the support of their families when making care plan decisions As a result keeping families updated on the care of their loved one can be challenging Since doctors and nurses are usually unable to meet families in-person the social work staff completes a general assessment with the patients and families that provides the interaction needed to address concerns and answer questions", "Watts also ensures her staffs hard work does not go unnoticed She encourages and recognizes her employees while creating a positive environment to help boost morale during difficult times This has included ordering shirts for her staff to wear on Fridays and socially distanced gatherings Three of Watts social workers had babies during the pandemic and her staff made signs and used FaceTime to interact with colleagues and meet their newborns ", "Watts believes that social workers are some of the most adaptable professionals because they have learned to adjust in order to meet the needs of the patients She has been most impressed with her staffs creativity and ability to acclimate daily Watts inpatient staff was initially told to work remotely from the social work office because of PPE conservation efforts They performed their duties with all patients and families by phone and shifted their mindset to work in a call center-like atmosphere Once community spread of the coronavirus increased Watts was told that her that social workers needed to return to their units due to the need to social distance", "While the number of coronavirus diagnoses continue to rise in South Carolina it has also led to an increase in mental health cases Watts staff includes emergency department social workers who work 12-hour shifts as mental health consultants to physicians", "Even though hospital volume decreased for a period of time the volume of mental health cases has not waivered Watts says They ER social workers understand that their work sometimes has nothing to do with the pandemic People in a mental health crisis need continued support and we never stop seeing those patients face-to-face for providing the best level of support", "Even though my staff is not clinical they can examine a chart provide feedback and communicate to the clinical staff that the patients family has questions Watts says We give families that personal connection to say that we have not forgotten about their loved ones and promise that we are taking care of them Weve always had a reputation of being available to families anytime when they call or need information", "For me it was more of a mental health hit because you do all of your work in one space Kintzios says The transition was difficult because I was not leaving my house to attend class so school and regular life have been morphed together and its hard to distinguish between the two", "I came to James Madison as a psychology major but felt there was not a path and didnt know what I wanted to do Kintzios says My advisor said people who are unsure about psychology go to social work Without thinking about it I switched my major to social work that same day My first class was the following semester and fortunately I loved it I took a big leap going in blind but was happy that I switched", "I dont think the short turnaround was difficult because it felt like a winter break Bollhorst says If we had a longer break I would be more hesitant about starting grad school", "I had a car a place to live and went to school I thought about all of those things and it really took a toll on me because I didnt want them to portray me as selfish Martin says But once I started working at the center I knew that this was the population I wanted to work with They just needed so much guidance and attention in a good way and adequate love and support that they never had previously My manager opened my eyes to the homeless population and how much its underserved", "I had life experiences growing up where social workers were involved Martin says Ive always been the type of person that people can talk to Once I started taking social work classes it was a perfect fit and I started being more successful academically", "I just told my advisor to place me anywhere I told her that Ill try new things and really didnt have an interest or dislike Martin says", "I learned in fifth grade that I had cousins who were in foster care Kandetzki says Knowing they went through hard times growing up while I had two parents siblings and other things made me realize how some people were not as fortunate as me Combined with my love of volunteering this was pivotal in choosing social work", "I think there is a little lack of understanding for what we do daily But at the end of the day it comes down to an inner strength of knowing that we are providing the best support for Lexington Medical Center patients and families with the resources we have available Watts says In the first weeks of the pandemic everyone was running on adrenaline because they wanted to contribute But it became exhausting after about a month so we had to dig deep to remember our purpose The Lexington Medical Center social workers have great internal morale so its not too hard to keep it up but you have to continue to find ways to be purposeful", "I was expecting it to be harder here because we were all stressed about grad school being online at first But the professors have been very understanding and theres been a learning curve because we used a different online platform at JMU Kandetzki says", "I was originally a biologypre-med major but after taking a few classes I realized it was not for me Bollhorst says I went through a catalog with all majors and highlighted social work After attending a meeting to learn more I felt like social work fit in with everything being discussed I started taking classes the following semester and enjoyed them enough to keep going", "I was really excited to only have a month break because it gave me that motivation and still be in the school mode Kintzios says Finishing the last semester of undergrad was stressful but Im better at doing my work now than I would be if my first semester was in the fall", "It makes me grateful to have people that I know because the process of grad school and being in a new place can be scary Bollhorst says Its great having friends who I can work with and turn to if I need to talk about anything", "It only took them two or three days to adjust to the new normal on not being on units Watts says Seeing our social workers learning how to adapt has been one of the glaring positives from COVID-19 because my staff members have proven themselves", "Its more of a collaborative effort and the teachers are willing to work with you and hear your perspective Kintzios says Our BSW program was building our professional profile and figuring out who we were as a social worker But its very refreshing to have teachers that not only teach but take the journey with you", "Im looking forward to meeting the students and developing relationships with them Morgan says I have an open-door or in this case an open-virtual space policy and hope students will reach out to me often", "My focus is on providing support and leadership for students and faculty at the Greenville MSW site to ensure the continued high standards and excellence in the classroom and in field Morgan says For the long haul Id love to see the program grow Recruitment retention and community engagement are on my list of goals as well", "One person on my staff who has worked in the COVID-19 unit since the beginning told a patient Tell me what I can answer for you because I know the nursing staff is busy and Ill do my best to support you Watts says Shes answering questions we may not typically answer but while the nurses and physicians are busy we can take a step back to help", "Social workers are big on connections and networking Kintzios says I think we will always be there for each other professionally and support each other if one of us ever needs anything", "Some people think of social workers as only for children and the elderly but they never think about the people in-between Martin says They need social workers just as much as anyone else and thats why I want to pursue a career working with young adults Its about helping someone how I can provide for families or just being there for support", "The professors here are very personable and its nice to see that they are more willing to engage with the students I like their style of teaching by giving more examples based on their own work and experiences Bollhorst says", "We can sometimes be complacent with our assessment skills saying I already know this patient came from a nursing home so I probably dont need to go in and see them Now that my staff has been unable to see their patients they understand the importance of face-to-face interaction Watts says Right now we stand by the door with our mask or face shield and try to eliminate any risk of exposure It goes against so much of what we are as social workers to provide that personal touch and say Its all right Im here What can I do? They will appreciate that interaction so much more beyond the pandemic", "We had a staff meeting on March 16 to introduce the idea of what we thought was happening Watts says Social workers were not recommended to go into some rooms in order to conserve Personal Protective Equipment but still could provide support over the phone We did not really understand the virus enough at that point but things have certainly changed since then", "We thought What if we all ended up at South Carolina? After I learned that I was accepted Madison found out she got in and about a week later Kassie was accepted Kandetzki says I went from thinking that I was moving to South Carolina and living alone to Im moving and living with Madison to were all going", "A book everyone should read is Just Mercy A Story of Justice and Redemption by Bryan Stevenson Its beautifully written heartbreaking and

sessions for private therapists and counselors one alumna has joined others in using a method that has become increasingly popular for providing mental health services", "Advanced Standing student Raven Martin did not choose social work as her first or second undergraduate major But it only took one social work class at Ferrum College in Virginia for Martin to discover her passion for social work An internship also had a major impact which helped her focus on a career helping homeless populations", "As Martin prepared for a three-week summer internship course last year she was unsure of where she wanted to complete her field experience While she knew her future would be in social work she did not have a specific interest", "As part of the Advanced Standing program Martin started

disadvantaged families According to Kim only eight percent of potentially eligible children under federal guidelines received subsidies in 2016 While the subsidy take-up is low for families of color

meeting over coffee she asked me if I wanted to be her graduate assistant", "I worked in a space that was filled with a majority of black women with social work degrees who were older than me Simon says Even though they had more experience they were also stuck in trying to figure out their next steps I also sought advice from my classmates and the majority that responded were black women They were also stuck and not able to find advice for the things they were experiencing on how to accomplish their goals", "It might have been the first time that program officers from the NIH attend SSWR to talk about grant applications and funding opportunities which was really informative and helpful Xu says Some junior faculty also discussed how NIH-K awards further developed their research training and helped them become independent investigators I focused more on workshops in previous conferences but this year I attended more grant writing and funding opportunity presentations", "Its very hard for a black woman to be vulnerable in front of other people especially other black women because its a deep-down feeling of needing to be perfect according to society Simon says I felt the same way of not wanting to be vulnerable and afraid of telling people of what I was experiencing in order to get the advice and feedback that I needed Its great having this non-judgmental space and seeing black women be freely vulnerable to share their stories and provide feedback", "One of the biggest differences between now and when I was a student was how to do more research to address critical social issues we are facing and how to work with state agencies and organizations to make structural changes Xu says", "Professor Yoonsook Ha and I met at the 2016 Population Association of America Conference in Chicago We started talking about our research and found out we have similar research interests on how the child care subsidy policies are helping low-income working families with young children Kim says", "Rachel has a balance of great ideas excellent communication skills and the ability to pull everything together and get things done Andrews says She has a commitment to developing innovative ways to treat substance abuse disorder and I have been impressed by her initiative in terms of her interest in learning and gathering as much information as she can from different experiences that we have made available", "Self-care meet ups help prevent burnout in the field Simon says We also use it as a networking opportunity It turned into something that I did for myself but ended up being much bigger than me", "She owed money to the shelter because there is a small fee for families and was also behind on paying for her daughters day care Simon says With her permission I reached out to our state representatives and let them know that we had a member who is having a hard time and how I would love to collect money to assist her We raised 900 in one day and paid her transitional housing fees and her daughters day care for two weeks I also bought groceries and other supplies That moment put everything into perspective on how when we think we have it all lifes struggles can happen anytime", "The best thing about working with her Andrews is that she has a rich understanding of some of the issues were dealing with Carlson says I love my field placement at the Substance Abuse Prevention and Education office on campus because I work with students with substance use issues But when I go to Dr Andrews she provides the full insurance policy government

shared these student conversations and my rep graciously offered me two access codes so they could access the text free of charge I remembered as a student of many years there were semesters wherein
