100000 for dorm construction which began in 1923 with the first women moving in in 1924 That year women represented one-fourth of total enrollment at the university That first dorm was named in honor of Wade Hampton though the actual naming didnt happen until 1940", "The history of womens dorms at Carolina goes back 100 years and over time there have been quite a few womens-only dorms on campus including back in the day Capstone Columbia Hall Patterson South Tower and even two of the since-demolished Honeycombs All of the rest are now co-ed residence halls", "The original womens dorm Wade

students alike", "USCs Reconstruction era lasted a little less than four years Henry Hayne the first Black student to enroll had not quite completed his medical degree when the Reconstruction era ended South Carolinas state Legislature returned to being an all-white body and those politicians closed USC in 1877 reopening it in 1880 as once again an all-white institution In the first six decades of the 20th century descendants of some of those Reconstruction-era students would apply for and be denied admission to USC It wasnt until 1963 90 years after its first desegregation that the university would admit Black students again", "Unsurprisingly the hostile attitude toward co-education resulted in low female enrollment Only 10 of Carolinas 298 students in the 1908-09 academic year were women The university entertained the idea of acquiring the College for Women a Columbia-based institution that was having financial difficulties The state Legislature did not approve the deal but

fly And learn how to fly means you know you pull the one stick back and the houses get smaller You push it forward and they get bigger and so on And my granddad soloed on a dare from his brother and his eventual brother-in-law around the Wisconsin farm when he was 12 So he took the airplane up by himself at age 12 and managed to land it And after that they all wound up with careers in aviation of one kind or another", "This is the part that actually makes no sense at all unless maybe youre 17 years old And that is on the way back from seeing where a plane crashed where people had died what do you do? Well naturally you drive by the airport and stop into the local flight school and sign up for flying lessons So I literally got into aviation by accident but I was immediately hooked on it I finished my private pilot certificate by the time Id graduated from high school and entered as a freshman at the University of South Carolina", "Along with being an engineering student Bootle is also an Air Force ROTC cadet at USC and he is way too smart to let me fly a real plane that hes riding in Were actually in a flight simulator located in USCs College of Engineering and Computing The simulator is really cool it looks and sounds and feels just like what you would experience inside a single-engine propeller plane", "And the really cool thing about the simulator is that its a simulator my attempted landing of the plane was disastrous Mayday!

roadblock", "But before we take off with all of that Jacob Bootle wants me to land this thing", "Case in point was Lester Hembel a Wisconsin farmboy who learned to fly a plane by himself at the tender age of 12 His grandson Connor Walker tells the story", "Connor Walker Her university time was important to her and she wound up kind of I dont think she intentionally wanted to continue a legacy or anything as high-minded as that but she pursued her current skill set with flying paired with her university degree and that made her competitive for a flying job with the state as well as an airline position with Piedmont Airlines eventually US Air Airlines And her parents I think being an aviation family they were probably quite proud of her I know I was", "Connor Walker Of course it was not a highly regulated industry at that point You had an airplane You could go do whatever you wanted with it", "Connor has been a commercial airline pilot now for nearly 40 years and his oldest son is

plane crashes like the one he saw when he was 17 and first got interested in aviation Sumwalt now heads the center for aviation and aerospace safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University", "His grandson Robert Sumwalt III likes to say that he got interested in aviation by accident Heres how it happened", "I looked high and low in old newspapers and other archives but couldnt confirm whether

students feel comfortable when they come to college And we want to be inclusive of what their needs are And we know that who their roommates are and their living environment has an impact on whether or not they decide to stay here So for example if we only had co-ed options and someone thought Oh well geez I cant go to the University of South Carolina because there isnt a womens-only option then we could lose students or they would be in an environment where they didnt feel comfortable if they came anyway and we might lose them that way too So I think its about providing all the options that students want and weve increased that in so many different ways over time And keeping this one thing I think is a good thing", "Les and Caroline later got married and in the early 1960s they persuaded

people the only thing they know of Gamecock womens basketball is Dawn Staley And Coach Staley has had such tremendous success at Carolina But South Carolina womens basketball was at an elite level once before in the late 70s and early 80s under Coach Parsons They finished third in the nation one season They won a WNIT championship a season before that they had a number one recruiting class in 1981 So she really had that program on the rise and it was an elite program for a short period You know unfortunately there was a bit of a scandal with Coach Parsons There was a relationship with a player Theres a chapter on sort of the evolution of womens sports And it really the biggest part of that chapter is around Coach Parsons and her program I didnt know how to write that story Its such a difficult story and I actually set the book down for about a year and a half until I could you know wrap my wrap my head around it", "Alan Piercy Bobby Richardson comes on board in 1970 to take over

takes over and 77 was Coach Raines first season and he takes them right back to the College World Series And both that 75 and 77 team they went to the championship game and so they finished runner-up

its just a chance to revisit some of those characters to you know sit inside Carolina Coliseum and Sarge Frye Field again and just sort of relive those times Such great characters such fun stories and not all fun stories Theres some dark stories too but I think its going to be a trip down memory lane for anybody who lived those times and remembers those characters For the younger fans who have no living memory of South Carolina athletics outside of the SEC I think its just an opportunity to sort of have a better understanding of how we got to where we are and to maybe learn a little bit about you know what things were like before South Carolina was in the SEC And I think it also puts things into perspective You know were going through this massive conference realignment situation right now across the college landscape Its not the first time thats happened There have been massive realignments in the past And so I think it you know theres some things in the book that can maybe lend some understanding to how things have gotten to where they are", "Alan Piercy George Rogers obviously it might be the biggest story from those independent years kid from Duluth Georgia who came to South Carolina His choice was down to Georgia Tech and Tennessee and South Carolina And Coach Carlen was the only coach that promised him an opportunity to play as a freshman And he said Well thats thats my school then So he came to Carolina and had just a phenomenal career Obviously ended up as a Heisman Trophy winner his senior year 1980 the opening game of his junior year against North Carolina in 79 He ran for 99 yards And that was his last game below 100 yards every game after that you know I think it was 22 straight games he ran for over 100 yards So just a magnificent career for him and of course went on to a great NFL career as well", "Alan Piercy I was fortunate to have a dad who took me to ball games And so we spent a lot of time at the old Carolina Coliseum and Williams-Brice and

didnt like it They didnt think he was dignified enough And Linda Singer said he looked pregnant He was small on top and big in the middle They brought Big Spur back to finish that season Cocky started working womens basketball games and June Raines invited Cocky to come on out to the baseball games and so he did that and by 81 he was back at the football games and really since then has just been a

an elite program who was poised to I mean theres no reason to think that they couldnt have had success on par with North Carolina or Duke long term You know you think about maybe McGuire would have still stepped aside in the 1980 time frame but maybe you know Bobby Cremins would have come along or ah somebody with ties to the program you know a McGuire legacy coach Thats just unfortunately not the way things played out And were still I think struggling to get back to where we were in mens basketball Having said that theres no doubt in my mind that were better off now in the SEC than we were You know we went through that 20 year period and fortunately for us we landed in the SEC You know it almost didnt work out that way So we were very fortunate that we landed there And you know 30-plus

number of years Unfortunately those intense rivalries were no longer there The ACC teams outside of Clemson were not playing South Carolina and so that affected recruiting It affected fan interest

there and literally watch people cross the street to avoid having to interact with the students And then once they got past them cross the street and then keep going on their way So it was an

Gamecock athletics Check it out on Substack when you can", "Alan Piercy A lot of people particularly younger people the only thing they know of Gamecock womens basketball is Dawn Staley And Coach Staley has had such tremendous success at Carolina But South Carolina womens basketball was at an elite level once before in the late 70s and early 80s under Coach Parsons They finished third in the nation one season They won a WNIT championship a season before that they had a number one recruiting class in 1981 So she really had that program on the rise and it was an elite program for a short period You know unfortunately there was a bit of a scandal with Coach Parsons There was a relationship with a player Theres a chapter on sort of the evolution of womens sports And it really the biggest part of that chapter is around Coach Parsons and her program I didnt know how to write that story Its such a difficult story and I actually set the book down for about a year and a half until I could you know wrap my wrap my head around it", "Alan Piercy Bobby Richardson comes on board in 1970 to take over the baseball program and he turned that program around by 1975 had South Carolina in Omaha for the first time their first college World Series He steps aside in 76 to run for Congress and June Raines takes over and 77 was Coach Raines first season and he takes them right back to the College World Series And both that 75 and 77 team they went to the championship game and so they finished runner-up in both of those seasons So the baseball program really became a nationally relevant national power during those years", "Alan Piercy For for those of us that lived through it that remember those days its just a chance to revisit some of those characters to you know sit inside Carolina Coliseum and Sarge Frye Field again and just sort of relive those times Such great characters such fun stories and not all fun stories Theres some dark stories too but I think its going to be a trip down memory lane for anybody who lived those times and remembers those characters For the younger fans who have no living memory of South Carolina athletics outside of the SEC I think its just an opportunity to sort of have a better understanding of how we got to where we are and to maybe learn a little bit about you know what things were like before South Carolina was in the SEC And I think it also puts things into perspective You know were going through this massive conference realignment situation right now across the college landscape Its not the first time thats happened There have been massive realignments in the past And so I think it you know theres some things in the book that can maybe lend some understanding to how things have gotten to where they are", "Alan Piercy George Rogers obviously it might be the biggest story from those independent years kid from Duluth Georgia who came to South Carolina His choice was down to Georgia Tech and Tennessee and South Carolina And Coach Carlen was the only coach that promised him an opportunity to play as a freshman And he said Well thats thats my school then So he came to Carolina and had just a phenomenal career Obviously ended up as a Heisman Trophy winner his senior year 1980 the opening game of his junior year against North Carolina in 79 He ran for 99 yards And that was his last game below 100 yards every game after that you know I think it was 22 straight games he ran for over 100 yards So just a magnificent career for him and of course went on to a great NFL career as well", "Alan Piercy I was fortunate to have a dad who took me to ball games And so we spent a lot of time at the old Carolina Coliseum and Williams-Brice and Sarge Frye field the old baseball stadium And so my first year that I remember going to games was 1980 going into the 80-81 school year And you think back to what happened in that year George Rogers won the Heisman Trophy Zam Frederick led the nation in scoring in basketball And our baseball team went to Omaha to the College World Series So that was a pretty great introduction to Gamecock sports I was 8 turning 9 that year and was just hooked and have been a big Gamecock fan ever since", "Alan Piercy Linda Singer who was the cheerleader coach at the time decided she wanted a more huggable softer friendlier bird And so she had that Cocky costume manufactured and initially it was not well received by fans I think it debuted for the Homecoming game in 1980 against Cincinnati And fans didnt like it They didnt think he was dignified enough And Linda Singer said he looked pregnant He was small on top and big in the middle They brought Big Spur back to finish that season Cocky started working womens basketball games and June Raines invited Cocky to come on out to the baseball games and so he did that and by 81 he was back at the football games and really since then has just been a fixture at Carolina and just an icon at Carolina", "Alan Piercy My personal opinion is I do think it was a mistake to leave the ACC certainly in terms of what it did to our basketball program You had an elite program who was poised to I mean theres no reason to think that they couldnt have had success on par with North Carolina or Duke long term You know you think about maybe McGuire would have still stepped aside in the 1980 time frame but maybe you know Bobby Cremins would have come along or ah somebody with ties to the program you know a McGuire legacy coach Thats just unfortunately not the way things played out And were still I think struggling to get back to where we were in mens basketball Having said that theres no doubt in my mind that were better off now in the SEC than we were You know we went through that 20 year period and fortunately for us we landed in the SEC You know it almost didnt work out that way So we were very fortunate that we landed there And you know 30-plus years down the road theres no doubt in my mind that were in a better place now", "Alan Piercy This 20-year period is really an interesting period Theres so many things going on Were just on the heels of the civil rights movement Black athletes are on scholarship at Southern colleges for the first time ever Title IX happens during this period Womens sports go from club level competition to varsity status The story of conference realignment which is still a big story today Carolina played a big part in that in the ACC and the SEC College athletics becomes big business during this time television deals ESPN comes along during this time So I started thinking about everything that was happening during this 20-year period and its really the story of all of those things sort of through the lens of Gamecock athletics", "Alan Piercy When the 71-72 season rolls around Carolina is a major independent now and theyre still the reigning ACC champs And there were still great basketball teams for a number of years Unfortunately those intense rivalries were no longer there The ACC teams outside of Clemson were not playing South Carolina and so that affected recruiting It affected fan interest Unfortunately that program sort of slid into decline But there were still some great seasons You think about the likes of Alex English and some of the others that came through that program", "Alan has also written a book thats due out next month

came on the scene just after the Frank McGuire era ended in 1980 Instead Alan decided to expand the scope of the book to cover everything that happened in USC sports after the university left the ACC", "All of these book titles are obviously linked to the Palmetto State and they share something else in common They were all published by the University of South Carolina Press which in the past 80 years has edited and published more than 1000 books on topics such as history and culture literature and cuisine and much more", "As I perused a pre-publication copy of Alans book I was reminded of just how much happened not only in Gamecock sports but in the college sports world in general from the early 70s to the early 90s There were scandals and probations around the country and the same things happened at USC during that era Fortunately the highs more than evened out the lows and set the stage for future success", "Back in the spring we had an episode about why USC left the ACC in

interest the kinds of books that often appeal to specific and smaller audiences", "Both books are written by Christina Rae Butler an historian who lives in downtown Charleston She says a university press is the best publisher for these types of books", "Christine Rae Butler I think its so easy now to self publish and get information out and put things online which is wonderful but theres almost no check and balance for that anymore And so I think academic presses are more important now than ever because those products are going to be vetted and peer reviewed And whether youre just a lay person picking up a book for fun or a scholar you know that that book matters You know that its not a curious opinion kind of filtered through as fact So I think just the legitimacy of the product is

of color and splendor to the green oasis that is Carolina", "Two hundred years ago taking a tour of the University of South Carolina campus would have been pretty simple The entire campus back then consisted of the Horseshoe and there were only a handful of buildings on it with maybe a hundred students After a leisurely 5-minute stroll your tour would have been done", "University Ambassadors have got to keep a lot of facts and figures about the university in their heads while theyre herding groups across campus for 90-minute tours stopping in the shade on hot days and handing out

the Barringer house It came into the universitys possession in 1972 The original garden had a formal layout with mixed borders of flowering shrubs and perennials but the garden had really fallen into disrepair and it was rescued by a generous donor in 2017 And this was a resident of the University Hill neighborhood who remembered playing in this garden as a child And thanks to her donation we were able to resurrect the planting beds upgrade the turf do a couple of other improvements I think its one of the really prime gardens on campus And whenever I go over there I invariably will see students

see me And so I didnt run but I was moving pretty quick because I was afraid something had happened to him And as I got closer I noticed he had a divot of grass that was around a sprinkler head and he was putting it back in place and he was tamping it down and he was yelling Grow grow!

down just slow down Itll be all right", "Sid Kenyon Sarge if you knew Sarge he called just about everybody Bubba and he said Bubba you know I didnt really know that much about it at first he says but I noticed if I was hauling fertilizer around somewhere whenever fertilizer fell off my little cart and you put water on it and the sun hit it grass grew So I mean Im sure he was underselling his

mattress I need something kind of firm So she spent the morning at facilities and she had them bring up three different thicknesses of plywood and she settled on the thickest one I think it was three quarter inch or something And she got them to put that under the bed for him so that he could be comfortable when he slept there But then apparently the following morning the housekeeper came down and

different ways For awhile students were allowed to leave campus and take their meals at one of several boardinghouses nearby The problem with that was the boardinghouses were also taverns which meant that it was a little too easy for students to wash down their meals with some strong drink You might recall that South Carolina College built a wall around the campus in the 1830s to try to keep the students from going to those taverns at night Check out the episode called The Great Wall of Carolina to see how that turned out", "The students considered it a matter of honor They had pledged to

structures and spaces youre going to have to remove people And in the case of Ward One and Wheeler Hill those are largely African American communities African American neighborhoods And so for our campus to grow it meant the displacement of African American families It meant the removal of black educational facilities It meant the removal of black churches and black businesses And so very often in our institutional history we underscore the expansion but very often we do not discuss at whose expense", "But Havilah Babcocks I Want a Word course was much more than merely teaching students to use 25-cent words He broadened their vocabularies for sure but he also genuinely liked his students and tried to engage with them in fun ways His granddaughter Barbara Babcock Weston remembered that her grandfather would give the students a daily quiz and whoever had the lowest score was sent the the campus canteen to get a chocolate milkshake for the professor Students appreciated the opportunity to enrich themselves when Babcock would announce Ill give a quarter to anyone who can spell and it would be some multisyllabic word on their vocabulary list", "But in nature the situation is always changing Rudy says a predator that used to be wary of humans has re-emerged on the campus in the past few decades or so", "But there was one thing that Babcock loved at least as much as

greater injury to the graduates and faculty of Booker Washington our universitys facilities leadership decides that when the building of BTW is torn down that the remnant bricks of the building would then be used to repave portions of the historic university Horseshoe And you might imagine what that felt like to the African American families who they thought of Booker T Washington as a shrine And

who lived in the Ward One and Wheeler Hill areas", "Heres one last little-known fact about Havilah Babcock He and his wife Alice were fond of camellia bushes and they cultivated quite a few of them in

suspended our football games against Clemson until 1909 and then the violence of the game terrible injuries broken jaws broken bones and some deaths nationwide to the point where President Theodore
